# Morse Game

Tired of the endless cycle of forgetting and relearning Morse Code?

No? Just me?

Morse Game is a simple Python script that runs a quiz where you are given a letter/code and asked to answer with the corresponding code/letter (depending on what you select when it starts)

## Running the Program

Navigate to the morse-game directory and type `morse`

To run the program from anywhere on your computer, type the following command: `cp morse ~/.local/bin`. If you update `morse`, you'll need to run the command `rm ~/.local/bin/morse && cp morse ~/.local/bin`
